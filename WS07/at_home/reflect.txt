1. Does the Hero class need to know about the existence of the SuperHero class? (Hint: search for “SuperHero” in Hero.cpp).
-> The base class Hero does not need to know about derived class SuperHero because of class hierarchy.


2. Does the SuperHero class need to know about the existence of the Hero class? (Hint: search for “Hero” in SuperHero.cpp)
-> The derived class SuperHero requires an instance variables from it's base class Hero so it must aware of it's base class existance.


3. The program prints out “Ancient Battle!” when two Heroes fight. It prints out “Super Fight!” when two SuperHeroes fight. When you made a Hero fight a SuperHero, what did it print out?
-> It printed out an "Ancient Battle!" because the base class Hero did not use the instance varibles of derived class SuperHero.


4. True or False: is the following definition for main valid? Explain.
	int main() {
  		Hero("Achilles", 20, 6) * Hero("Hector", 30, 5);
}
-> True


5. True or False: is the following definition for main valid? Explain.
int main() {
 (Hero("Achilles", 20, 6) * Hero("Hector", 30, 5)) 
                          *
 (Hero("Atalanta", 10, 3) * Hero("Hippolyta", 10, 2));
}

-> True

Both are valid because the overloaded '*' operator return a valid Hero Class.
